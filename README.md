# Automakefile
Create an automakefile in C, so in the case you're writing a program and you create a new file and you wanna fill it in the Makefile, you only need to call the function automakefile.sh

To execute ./automakefile.sh [EXECUTABLE_NAME] [LIBRARY]
EXECUTABLE_NAME: name of the executable you want.
LIBRARY: name of the library

In this case the Library name is only avalaible with the name "csfml"
Feel free to change it as you desire.
